<h1>osx2x help</h1>

<p>Current version: 2.2.0</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to osx2x. osx2x is an application designed to help people with multiple computers on their desk free up some desk space by reducing the number keyboards and mice they need. It allows the user to use just the keyboard and mouse on their Mac OS X machine to control another machine running either an X11 server or a VNC server.</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/connections.png"></p>

<p>For example, in the above setup, the left machine runs X11 and the right machine runs Mac OS X with a VNC server running. The keyboard and mouse of the middle machine, running osx2x, can be used to control the left and right machine by forwarding any input from the middle machine to the other two. Better yet, osx2x can be set up so that you just move the mouse off the left on the middle machine's screen and it appears to move the cursor on the left hand machine as if it where one continuous desktop!</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To run osx2x you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Apple Macintosh running Mac OS X 10.2 or later.
<li>A set of X Windows libraries installed on the Mac (either from Apple's X11 beta or X Darwin).
<li>Up to four machines running either:

<ul>
<li>An X11 Windows server which supports the XTest extention. Most popular
X11 Windows servers support this. osx2x has been tested with XFree86 on Linux and FreeBSD, the Sun Solaris
X11 Windows server, and Apple's X11 server release.
<li>A VNC server. osx2x has been tested with osxVNC and with the AT&T VNC server on FreeBSD.
</ul>

<li>A network connection between the machines.
</ul>

<h2>The osx2x Window</h2>

<p>The below diagram shows the main osx2x window. It is a very basic interface, 
with only three widgets:</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/osx2x.png"></p>

<p>The top section lists the current connections made. In the above picture the user is connected to a VNC server on a machine called ofhidro and to an X11 server on a machine called kettle. The edge position field notes that if the mouse is moved off the east side of the controlling machine's screen it will start working on the machine called ofhidro, and if moved off the west side of the screen it will start controlling kettle.</p>

<p>The two buttons on the main window allow you to create a new connection, or to close an existing connection. When you click the New Connection button you will see a panel like the one shown below:</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/panel.png"></p>

<p>The first entry in the panel is used to specify the target host which you wish to control, specified in the form of hostname:screen-number, similar to the format used in the first screen shot. If you drop down this combo box, you should see the last five servers you connected to, and selecting one will update the rest of the panel to the settings you last used with that server. The next item is for enabling edge detection. There are five options here: None, East, West, North, or South. With None selected, osx2x will require you to use a keypress to toggle when keyboard and mouse events are sent to the X Windows server. If you enable either East, West, North, or South then osx2x will let you move the mouse off that side of the screen and then control of remote host will be activated, moving the cursor to the opposide edge of the remote display, creating the illusion of a single contiguous desktop. The third item lets you specify whether you are connecting to a X11 or VNC server.</p> 

<p>The fourth item allows you to tell osx2x to automatically reconnect to this server, if it is available, next time you launch osx2x. This saves you having to open a regular set of connections every time you run osx2x. You can also enable or disable this option for active connections from the connection menu.</p>

<p>The next two fields are used for authentication, used depending on the connection method used. Currently no authenication is used for an X11 connection, and only the password field is used for VNC authentication. Finally there is a connect button to attempt the connection and a cancel button to not do the connection.</p>


<h2>Operation</h2>

<p>The following steps indicate how to use osx2x. To make the description easier,
we assume you have two machines named <em>machost</em> and either <em>xwindowshost</em> or <em>vnchost</em>, on which you are running osx2x and either an X Windows server or VNC server respectively.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up the remote host:

<ul>
<li>On xwindowshost, ensure that the server will allow the 
machost to connect. Do this by using <tt>xhost +machost</tt> (replacing machost with the
correct host name for your mac) on xwindowshost.
<li>On vnchost run the VNC server, setting a password if you wish to use one.
</ul>

<li>Launch osx2x, and click the New Connection button.
<li>Type the hostname of xwindowshost or vnchost into the combo box in osx2x, select the type of edge detection you desire, and the protocol you want to use. Optionally enter the password if using a VNC server, and then click connect.
<li>If osx2x was not able to connect, then it will display an error dialog box explaining why, 
otherwise the connect button will now be labelled disconnect.
<li>To control the remote host osx2x needs to be set to capture mode. You
 can do one of four things things to enable this:
  <ul>
  <li>When osx2x is in the foreground, use the "Toggle lock" option from the Control menu.
  <li>When osx2x is in the foreground, use the command-t key press
  <li>Regardless of whether osx2x is in the foreground or not, press command-F10. This will bring osx2x
  to the foreground and engage event capture.
  <li>If you enabled edge detection, drag the mouse off the appropriate side of the screen.
  </ul>
  Now all keyboard and mouse events should be sent to the remote server.
<li>To disengage event capture, you can do one of two things:
  <ul>
  <li>Press command-t to return to osx2x in non-capture mode.
  <li>Press command-F10 to deactivate event capture, and return osx2x to where it was in 
  the application ordering before it was activated.
  <li>If you activated control with edge detection, then move the mouse back off the remote screen
  on the side which the cursor joined.
  </ul>
<li>To disconnect from the remote server either press the disconnect button or quit osx2x.
</ol>

<p>When you move onto a remote session, you will see a translucent arrow appear on your monitor indicating off which side the cursor is. This is to aid you finding the cursor should you lose track of it (e.g., you return from getting coffee :). Unless you explicitly close it, the osx2x window will also pop up when you move the cursor onto a remote session. This was a requirement before version 2.1, but that is no longer the case, so you should close the osx2x window once you have finished adding any servers you want to the list. You can get the window back again by clicking on the osx2x icon in the dock.</p>

<p>While osx2x is in the foreground (regardless of whether keyboard events are being
forwarded or not) it can be used to copy and paste data between the Mac OS X pasteboard and
the X Windows clipboard (this functionality currently works with X11 remote hosts). Command-c will copy the contents of the current X selection from
X Windows server to the Mac OS X pasteboard. Command-v will cause osx2x to have the active
clipboard selection on the X Windows server.</p>

<h2>Preferences</h2>

<p>There are currently four items that can be set in the Preferences window:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hide window when not in foreground:</b> When set, the osx2x window will not be visable when osx2x is not the active application.
<li><b>Store VNC passwords in keychain:</b> Allows osx2x to remember VNC server passwords between sessions by storing them in the user's password keychain.
<li><b>Country map:</b> Currently osx2x supports mappings for US and German keyboards only.
<li><b>Direction arrow colour:</b> This lets you pick the colour of the arrow osx2x displays on screen when you move the cursor onto a remote screen.
</ul>


<h2>Issues</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>osx2x uses the standard X Windows XTest functionality to send events from the Mac to 
the X Windows server; without this then some custom software would have to run on the
X Windows host, which would limit the ability of osx2x to connect to clients without caring
about the remote machine type. Unfortunately, XTest is not secure, so all keyboard and 
mouse events are transmitted in plain text between the two machines. The same is true of the VNC protocol.
This is of particular 
importance if you use a WaveLAN network without WEP encryption. Thus, the user should be
aware of this when typing possibly sensitive information such as passwords on the remote 
session.</p>

<li><p>The clipboard/pasteboard functionality currently only supports data of type 
XA_STRING.</p>
